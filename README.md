# ARNav_IndoorNavigation_FYP

**Abstract**:
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple navigation tool for IBA Main Campus which would rely on augmented features to guide the user for direction. As this is for an institution, it would focus more on indoor navigation.We have created a mobile application for Android/IOS. Application will ask the user for destination. This could be any room inside the building such as classroom, faculty room, seminar etc. It would then calculate the shortest path using AI pathfinding algorithms, opens up user’s camera and guide the user using AR arrows/objects showing up on user’s screen.   
App has an additional feature of creating map so that user can add locations manually at run time.

**How to Use:**  
1)open project in unity.  
2)build project(for android only)
3)Run app;make sure your phone is ARCore supported  
(check it out here : https://developers.google.com/ar/devices)  
4)Initially you need to create a map.Move to a location, set pointer, name pointer, set drop points for the pointer by backtracking to your starting position.  
5)Create multiple maps.  
6)Search map.
